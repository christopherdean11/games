# Games For Learning
This repo is meant to house different language implementations of a slightly more advanced version of Tic Tac Toe. In this new version of the game you can specify the size of the board and how many boxes you must connect in a row to win independent of each other.  You can also customize the letter to represent each player. 

### Current Implementations
* Python (`pytictactoe`)
* C++ (`cpptictactoe`)


### Potential Future Implementations
* C
* Rust
* Swift
* C# (.NET core)
